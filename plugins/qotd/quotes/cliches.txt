Aviate, Navigate, Communicate.
%
Truly superior pilots are those who use their superior judgment to avoid those situations where they might have to use their superior skills.
%
Rule one: No matter what else happens, fly the airplane.
%
Flying is hours of boredom, punctuated by moments of stark terror.
%
Fly it until the last piece stops moving.
%
It's better to be down here wishing you were up there, than up there wishing you were down here.
%
An airplane will probably fly a little bit overgross but it sure won't fly without fuel.
%
Believe your instruments.
%
Think ahead of your airplane.
%
I’d rather be lucky than good.
%
The propeller is just a big fan in the front of the plane to keep the pilot cool. Want proof? Make it stop; then watch the pilot break out into a sweat.
%
If we are what we eat, then some pilots should eat more chicken.
%
I’d rather be a chicken than a turkey.
%
Without fuel, pilots become pedestrians.
%
Regards engine power: Lots is good, more is better, and too much is just enough.
%
If you’re ever faced with a forced landing at night, turn on the landing lights to see the landing area. If you don't like what you see, turn 'em back off.
%
A checkride ought to be like a skirt, short enough to be interesting but still be long enough to cover everything.
%
Standard checklist philosophy requires that pilots read to each other the actions they perform every flight, and recite from memory those they need every three years.
%
Experience is the knowledge that enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.
%
(The wisdom that enables us to recognize as an undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already embraced. — Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dictionary, 1911)
%
There are some flight instructors where the student is important, and there are some instructors where the instructor is important. Pick carefully.
%
Speed is life, altitude is life insurance.
%
No one has ever collided with the sky.
%
Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.
%
It's better to be down here wishing you were up there, than to be up there wishing you were down here.
%
One peek is worth a thousand instrument cross-checks.
%
Experience is a hard teacher. First comes the test, then the lesson.
%
Always remember you fly an airplane with your head, not your hands.
%
Never let an airplane take you somewhere you brain didn't get to five minutes earlier.
%
If it's red or dusty don't touch it.
%
Don't drop the aircraft in order to fly the microphone.
%
An airplane flies because of a principle discovered by Bernoulli, not Marconi.
%
Cessna pilots are always found in the wreckage with their hand around the microphone.
%
If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger, if you pull the stick back they get smaller.
%
To go up, pull the stick back. To go down, pull the stick back harder.
%
Hovering is for pilots who love to fly but have no place to go.
%
Flying is the second greatest thrill known to man…. Landing is the first!
%
Every one already knows the definition of a 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. But very few know the definition of a 'great landing.' It's one after which you can use the airplane another time.
%
Definition of 'pilot': The first one to arrive at the scene of an aircraft accident.
%
The probability of survival is equal to the angle of arrival.
%
There are two types of tailwheel (or retractable gear) pilot, those who have ground-looped (landed gear up) and those that will.
%
If you’ve got time to spare, go by air.
(More time yet? Go by jet.)
%
IFR: I Follow Roads.
%
You know you’ve landed with the wheels up when it takes full power to taxi.
%
If you don't gear up your brain before takeoff, you’ll probably gear up your airplane on landing.

Navy carrier pilots regards Air Force pilots:
“Flare to land, squat to pee.”
%
Air Force pilots regards Navy carrier pilots:
“Next time a war is decided by how well you land on a carrier, I’m sure our Navy will clean up. Until then, I’ll worry about who spends their training time flying and fighting.”
%
Navy pilots regards Air Force formation flying skills:
“Same way, same day.”
%
The three best things in life are a good landing, a good orgasm, and a good shit. A night carrier landing is one of the few opportunities to experience all three at the same time.
%
A kill is a kill.
%
He who sees first, lives longest.
%
Fighter pilots make movies, attack pilots make history.
%
In thrust I trust.
%
Jet noise: The sound of freedom.
%
I had a fighter pilot’s breakfast - two aspirin, a cup of coffee and a puke.
%
Those who hoot with the owls by night, should not fly with the eagles by day.
%
Fly with the eagles, or scratch with the chickens.
%
It only takes two things to fly, airspeed and money.
%
Forget all that stuff about thrust and drag, lift and gravity, an airplane flies because of money.
%
Do you see that propeller? Well, everything behind it revolves around money.
%
The similarity between air traffic controllers and pilots?
If a pilot screws up, the pilot dies.
If ATC screws up, the pilot dies.
%
Women! Can't live with 'em … can't lock 'em in the hangar.

I’m from the FAA, and I’m here to help.
%
A smooth touchdown in a simulator is as exciting as kissing your sister.
%
A helicopter is a collection of rotating parts going round and round and reciprocating parts going up and down - all of them trying to become random in motion.
%
Helicopters can't really fly - they’re just so ugly that the earth immediately repels them.
%
Helicopters don't fly. They beat the air into submission.
%
Helicopters don’t fly, they just vibrate against the earth and the earth rejects them into the air.
%
It's better to break ground and head into the wind than to break wind and head into the ground.
%
The owner's guide that comes with a $500 refrigerator makes more sense than the one that comes with a $50 million airliner.

If it doesn't work, rename it. If that doesn't help, the new name isn't long enough.
%
Flying is not Nintendo. You don't push a button and start over.
%
The seven P's:
Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance.

The future in aviation is the next 30 seconds. Long term planning is an hour and a half.
%
Life is lead points and habit patterns.
%
Gravity: killer of young adults.
%
I’m not speeding officer — I’m just flying low.
%
The only thing that scares me about flying is the drive to the airport.
%
Young man, was that a landing or were we shot down?
%
Sorry folks for the hard landing. It wasn't the pilot's fault, and it wasn't the plane's fault. It was the asphalt.
%
Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to make all of them yourself.
%
Three things kill young pilots in Alaska - weather, weather, and weather.
%
Please don't tell Mum I’m a pilot, she thinks I play piano in a whorehouse.

Pilots believe in clean living. They never drink whiskey from a dirty glass.
%
Never ask a man if he is a fighter pilot. If he is, he'll let you know. If he isn't, don't embarrass him.

%
'Please see me at once' memos from the Chief Pilot are distributed on Fridays after office hours.
%
There are no new ways to crash airplanes.
%
An accident investigation hearing is conducted by non-flying experts who need six months to itemize all the mistakes made by a crew in the six minutes it has to do anything.
%
Things which do you no good in aviation:
Altitude above you.
Runway behind you.
Fuel in the truck.
A navigator.
Half a second ago.
Approach plates in the car.
The airspeed you don't have.
%
It is far better to arrive late in this world than early in the next.
%
You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience. The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of luck.
%
The more traffic at an airport, the better it is handled.
%
If God meant man to fly, He'd have given us bigger wallets.
%
If God had meant for men to fly he would have made their bones hollow and not their heads.

What's the difference between God and pilots? God doesn't think he's a pilot.
%
Flying is not dangerous; crashing is dangerous.
%
You can land anywhere once.
%
Flying is the perfect vocation for a man who wants to feel like a boy, but not for one who still is.
%
There are four ways to fly: the right way, the wrong way, the company way and the captain's way. Only one counts.
%
A good simulator check ride is like successful surgery on a cadaver.
%
Asking what a pilot thinks about the FAA is like asking a fireplug what it thinks about dogs.

Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment.
%
Aviation is not so much a profession as it is a disease.
%
The nicer an airplane looks, the better it flies.
%
Why did God invent women when airplanes were so much fun?
%
Remember when sex was safe and flying was dangerous?
%
Jet and piston engines work on the same principle: suck, squeeze, bang, blow.
%
You can always depend on twin engine aircraft. When the first engine quits the second will surely fly you to the scene of an accident.
%
The real value of twin engine aircraft is it will double your chances of engine failure.
%
CAUTION: Aviation may be hazardous to your wealth.
%
If it ain't broke, don't fix it; if it ain't fixed, don't fly it.
%
A mechanics favorite: It's not a leak, its a seep.

%
The worst day of flying still beats the best day of real work.
%
A male pilot is a confused soul who talks about women when he's flying, and about flying when he's with a woman.
%
About aerobatics: It's like having sex and being in a car wreck at the same time.
%
A grease-job landing is 50 percent luck; two in a row are entirely luck; three in a row and someone's lying.
%
There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.
%
It's a good landing if you can still get the doors open.
%
First, listen to the question the student asked, then listen to the question he didn't ask and then figure out the question he really meant to ask.
%
Airspeed, altitude, or brains; you always need at least two.
%
A groundschool instructor understands piloting the way an astronomer understands the stars.
%
Gravity, it's not just a good idea, it's the law.
%
The Law of Gravity is not a general rule.
%
You can only tie the record for flying low.
%
Flying at night is the same as flying in the day, except you can't see.
%
It at first you don't succeed, well, so much for skydiving.
%
It is said that two wrongs do not make a right, but two Wrights do make an aeroplane.
%
When starting an aviation career it is not unusual to be overwhelmed, terrified, suffer from lack of confidence and be just plain scared. As experience grows, self confidence replaces fear … but after a time, when you think you have seen it all, you realize your initial reactions to flying were correct.
%
Any pilot who does not privately consider himself the best in the game is in the wrong game.
%
As a pilot only two bad things can happen to you and one of them will be:

a. One day you will walk out to the aircraft knowing that it is your last flight.
b. One day you will walk out to the airplane not knowing that it is your last flight.

It's better to die than to look bad, but it is possible to do both.
%
If something hasn't broken on your helicopter, it's about to.
%
Helicopters are really a bunch of parts flying in relatively close formation; all rotating around a different axis. Things work well until one of the parts breaks formation.
%
Flying is better than walking. Walking is better than running. Running is better than crawling. All of these however, are better than extraction by a Med-Evac helicopter, even if this is technically a form of flying.

%
If God had wanted me to fly, he would have made me flush riveted.
